The config file called dbconn with extension php (dbconn.php) and it should be as follows :

<?php

define('DB_HOST', ['your host name']);
define('DB_NAME', ['your database name']);
define('DB_USER', ['your user name']);
define('DB_PASSWORD', ['your user password']);

$con=mysqli_connect(DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, 3306) or die('Failed to connect to the database, died with error:');

if ($con->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $con->connect_error);
} 

?>
